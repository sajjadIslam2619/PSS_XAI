    "Dataset description: The MELD dataset is a multimodal, multi-party conversational corpus built from the TV series Friends. It contains about 13,000 utterances from 1,433 dialogues, each aligned with text, audio, and video clips. Every utterance is annotated with seven emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness, surprise) and mapped into sentiment classes (positive, negative, neutral). Compared to earlier datasets like EmotionLines, MELD offers multi-party conversations, improved annotation quality using multimodal cues, and nearly double the number of utterances available for emotion recognition in dialogue"
