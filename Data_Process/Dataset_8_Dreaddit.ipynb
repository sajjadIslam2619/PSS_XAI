    "Dataset description: The Dreaddit dataset consists of 187,444 Reddit posts collected from ten subreddits across five domains (abuse, anxiety, financial, PTSD, and social/relationships). A subset of 3,553 text segments was annotated through Amazon Mechanical Turk for stress classification, with labels indicating stressful or non-stressful content. Unlike short microblogs, Dreaddit provides long-form, multi-domain narratives, enabling deeper analysis of how stress is expressed in online communities."
