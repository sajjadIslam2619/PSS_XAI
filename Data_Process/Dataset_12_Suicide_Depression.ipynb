    "Dataset description: The studyâ€™s primary dataset was collected from Reddit posts in r/Depression and r/SuicideWatch, containing 1,895 posts labeled according to subreddit membership. To validate the label correction method, the authors also used the Reddit C-SSRS dataset (500 posts labeled by psychologists using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale) and the IMDB movie review dataset (50,000 reviews for sentiment classification). Additionally, posts from r/CasualConversation were used alongside r/SuicideWatch to construct a comparison dataset for suicide vs healthy classification"
