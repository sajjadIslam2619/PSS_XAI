    "Dataset description: The CAMS dataset is a curated corpus of 5051 Reddit posts that enables causal analysis of mental health issues in social media. Each post is annotated with a causal inference and categorized into one of six classes: no reason, bias or abuse, jobs and careers, medication, relationships, or alienation. It combines 3155 posts collected from r/depression with 1896 re-annotated posts from the SDCNL dataset, all verified by experts for reliability. This dataset is the first publicly available resource specifically designed for interpretable causal analysis in mental health research."
